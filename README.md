# SQL Database for Blockbuster

*Commit 1*

## 1. Preparations

   On this project I have to create an SQL database for blockbuster. The idea is that they will reopen and they need a new database for their stores. I have the data of their old store and I have to clean it and design the relations between the tables.

   Before I can start working I created a jupyter notebook file to cconnect to MySQL server and i created an empty database/schema to begin working from there.

   The first step is to understand the data. I will use the pandas library to load the .csv files and observe what type of data I am working with. I will start designing the ERD while i understand the data and the inner structure of the business.

## 2. Look at the Data

The first step is to understand the data. For this I load all the csv into dataframes from pandas and print the .head() of each df. It's important when importing pandas to set the option show all columns with this code:

      pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)

We start looking at the data to understand the relationships that need defining. Once I have this I will know which data to clean and which to preserve. The process will require a lot of updates and changes throughout the code. I will sequentialy describe my findings going back ad forth from cleaning, understanding and modelling the ERD.

## 3. Development

### 3.1 First Look

Issues:

1. There is no Customer table. It needs to be created with the relevant customer data.

2. The Update column doesn't fulfill any purpose. If you don't plan on keeping a history of every movement for future analisis it doesn't make sense.

3. Old information on rental needs to be deleted. We need the table to start from the day they reopen.

4. They are only opening one store so in innventory id we wouldnÂ´t need to declare the store. This may change, decition will be taken later.

5. Some films might be missing from the inventory. If there are no copies of them we should delete the file. It could also be very interesting to have a way of knowinng if the film is rented or not. I will add a column in the inventory table that determines the availability. 

6. Actors that don't appear on any film should also be cleaned.

7. Language and Category tables don't need the update time.

8. Intermediate table for Film, Actor relationship. old_HDD has the information needed for that intermediate table.

### 3.2 EDR V1

After looking at the data and writting down the relations between the data this is the structure.

*Commit 2,3 and 4*

### 3.3 Cleaning the data.

1. Deleting 'last update' columns in all tables.

2. Deleting unnecessary columns on films e.g. 'original_language_id'

3. Changing actor names from 'old' to actor_id and cleaning unnecessary columns.

*commit 5 and 6*

4. Category to film table. I have to clean the films that don't appear in old and check if they are in the inventory and then add the category.
